# Steel-and-Blackpowder-Development
This is just meant to be a forum for me to talk about and share updates for my main video game project, "Steel and Blackpowder".
Steel and Blackpowder is a strategy game in development. It is predominantly set within Africa and Arabia, but with time will recieve updates and expand.
Any help in developing UI, basic code, the map, or anything else is much appreciated! :)
